The Fee Estimator is an application that thousands of citizens use to estimate the cost of permitting in the City of Clearwater. It is a single-page VB.net Aspx application. It was not responsive and, most notably, not ADA compliant. 

**Here is the link to the image of the original page before I made any changes to it: https://bit.ly/3zGvjbh. There are no City markings, no City colors, and informational messages are in red.**

Below are the images of the features I introduced to the application.

ADA compliance. I have had the application reviewed by several colleagues who are ADA experts. And I made changes per their recommendations. No one can guarantee that their application is 100% compliant. But, if I find or someone notifies me of a violation, I correct it as quickly as possible.

All colors used in the application are also in the City logo:

It was challenging to use this application on any mobile device. I added Bootstrap to aid with device responsiveness. Example Emulation of iPhone 11

This would be a great application to convert to VueJs to eliminate the ASP.NET code.
